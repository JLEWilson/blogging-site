    <h2>Blog entry 10/13/21</h2>
    <p>Today marks my first blog entry! So far class has been great! Today was the first day that I finally feel comfortable using git commands. After seeing how beautiful my teams websites turned out it definitely set a fire under my but and made me want to add a lot more detail and design to my webpages instead of just showing that I understant the material. <span class="extremeEmphasis">EVER!</span></p>

    <h2>Journal entry 1 10/13/21</h2>
    <h3>Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing 27 weeks of technical training?</h3>
    <p>For a long time i've had a dream of being a game developer. A dream of seeing my ideas not only take form in a medium that I love, but of being able to share them with others in a way that brings people happiness, or at the very least respite. During covid we had the furtune of being able to live with my partners mother while she finished up her masters and I finally had some extra free time to be able to work towards that dream. In doing so I found out just how much there was to learn. I also found out the hard way how easy it is to spend tens of hours learning the wrong thing. One thing however that I did not expect was how much I would enjoy coding! I decided I would love to code for work even if it didn't end up being for game developement.</p>
    <h3>Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?</h3>
    <p>A long term goal of mine is to open small gaming studio where we can work on material that is more meaningful without having to endure the common pitfallls that plague the video game industry. In the short term, my primary goal is to learn as much as I can and meet great people along the way! Both which have started happening already.</p>

    <h2>Journal entry 2 10/17/21</h2>
    <h3>Are there times when it's easier or harder for you to ask for assistance from a peer? What about a teacher?</h3>
    <p>I feel like the less I know about the subject the more likely I am to ask for help. If I feel like I know enough to be able to find out the answer I will usually do a quick google search.</p>
    <h3>What factors make it harder to ask for help? Why do these stand in your way?</h3>
    <p>If I haven't at least tried to fix the bug myself I probably won't ask for help. However, when i've been working on a project for multiple hours in a row I am more likely to ask for a fresh set of eyes.</p>
    <h3>What can you do to minimize or eliminate these factors? In what ways could you practice sharing your problem solving process throughout the week?</h3>
